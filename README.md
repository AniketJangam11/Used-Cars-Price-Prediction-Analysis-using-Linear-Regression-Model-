# Used Cars Price Prediction Analysis using Linear Regression Model
This repository contains a project that focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using a linear regression model. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the selling price of a used car based on its various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information about different used cars, including features such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner details. The dataset also includes the selling price of each car.

## Approach
### The project follows these main steps:

### Data Exploration: 
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and identifying relationships between variables.

### Feature Engineering: 
Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as creating dummy variables for categorical features and transforming numerical features if needed.

### Model Development: 
Build a linear regression model using the preprocessed dataset. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, fit the model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

### Model Evaluation: 
Assess the performance of the linear regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score. Analyze the residuals to check for model assumptions and potential areas of improvement.

### Price Prediction: 
Utilize the trained linear regression model to predict the selling prices of new car instances or unseen data.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the linear regression model achieved a regression score of 76%. This indicates that the model was able to explain 76% of the variability in the target variable using the given features. While a score of 76% is relatively good, it is important to consider the context and the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
